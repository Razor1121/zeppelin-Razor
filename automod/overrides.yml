overrides:
    #Overrides are always calculated top down
    #For example:
    #If you want to have mods messages not be deleted, your overrides would need to be in this order:

    #1. Enable in channel xyz
    #2. Disable for mods
    #If you have it the other way round it'll delete everything, even from mods.

    - level: '>=60' #mods are not affected as its disabled for them
      config:
        can_view_antiraid: true #can view the antiraid level
        can_set_antiraid: true #can set the antiraid level
        rules:
          badwords:
            enabled: true 
          copypasta:
            enabled: true

#Add your automod rules here to disable them for staff.
