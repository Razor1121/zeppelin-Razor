Hello! To begin, I am in no way affiliated with Zeppelin.gg, their support team, or am an active contributor. Im just here to help.
- Zeppelin is pretty hard to use for anyone who's never coded a bot before, or has any coding experience. Luckily, I've went out of my way to make the easiest plug and play there possibly is. All you do is change
  what you need to change, and thats it! Easy as it gets.

  Check out https://discord.gg/9G264SWz if you need help, that is Zeppelin's support server for the public version of the bot. The self hosted version can be found here also with a link to their other server.

Check out how to fully configure the bot here: https://github.com/Razor1121/zeppelin-Razor/edit/main/README.md
