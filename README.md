# Hello! To begin, I am in no way affiliated with Zeppelin.gg, their support team, or am an active contributor. Im just here to help.
- Zeppelin is pretty hard to use for anyone who's never coded a bot before, or has any coding experience. Luckily, I've went out of my way to make the easiest plug and play there possibly is. All you do is change what you need to change, and thats it! Easy as it gets.
- Zeppelin is a general purpose moderation and server management bot designed with large servers in mind.
See the documentation for more details: https://zeppelin.gg/docs
- This configuration is made for the **Public Hosted** version

[setup](https://github.com/Razor1121/zeppelin-Razor/edit/main/README.md)  is the full code that I've worked on. For the `automod` configurations, please browse through the automod folder and check out each rule created there.
